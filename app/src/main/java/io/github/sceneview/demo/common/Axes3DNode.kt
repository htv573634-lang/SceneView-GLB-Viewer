/**
 * Blender-style 3D axes gizmo at the origin (0, 0, 0).
 *
 * Renders three thin coloured cylinders aligned with the world axes:
 * - **X** in red (`+X` direction)
 * - **Y** in green (`+Y` direction)
 * - **Z** in blue (`+Z` direction)
 *
 * Useful as a static reference in editing/debug demos so the user always knows where
 * the world origin is and how their gestures map onto axes. Cheap to draw — three
 * low-poly cylinders with unlit-style colour materials.
 *
 * Each cylinder is built along its native +Y axis with the requested half-length on
 * each side of the centre, then rotated so it aligns with the target axis. The X
 * cylinder is rotated 90° around Z to lie along +X; the Z cylinder is rotated 90°
 * around X to lie along +Z; the Y cylinder is left unrotated.
 *
 * Drop into any [SceneScope] content block:
 * ```kotlin
 * SceneView(...) {
 *     Axes3DNode(materialLoader = materialLoader)
 *     // your content
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param materialLoader The scene's [MaterialLoader] — required to mint the three axis materials.
 * @param length         Total length of each axis cylinder in metres. The axis extends from
 *                       `-length/2` to `+length/2` along its direction. Default `0.5f`.
 * @param thickness      Cylinder radius in metres. Keep small (~1% of [length]) so the axes
 *                       don't visually dominate the scene. Default `0.005f`.
 * @param colorX         Colour of the X axis. Default red.
 * @param colorY         Colour of the Y axis. Default green.
 * @param colorZ         Colour of the Z axis. Default blue.
